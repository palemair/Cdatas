## Introduction

This repository purpose is simply creating a Python Pandas-like in C programming language.
Written with GlibC, this is a simple programming practice.

It will include csv parser, of course, and i'd like to perform some utilities, such sorting, printing, writing to csv ...
I decided to choose a mixin data structure, a linked list array in order to avail the advantages of quick sorting array (verticaly) which
seems to me more frequent, and list horizontaly to avail the easiest and most efficient insert.
again, it's an educationnal exercise.

## To do

choose the most efficcient Data structure.
Parsing datatype (time,date ...)
